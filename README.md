# Citation Network SNA  

## Overview  
This project is a mini-project for the Social Network Analytics (CS342) course. It aims to analyze and visualize a citation network using real-world data. The project explores key network properties, such as centrality measures, hub and authority scores, and PageRank, to understand citation patterns and influence within the network.  

## Features  
- **Graph Construction**: Build a citation network using real-world citation data.  
- **Network Analysis**: Compute key network metrics such as degree distribution, clustering coefficient, and centrality measures.  
- **Hub & Authority Scores**: Calculate HITS scores to identify influential papers.  
- **PageRank Computation**: Analyze the importance of nodes using Google's PageRank algorithm.  
- **Visualization**: Display the citation network using NetworkX and Matplotlib.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **NetworkX**  
- **PyVis**  
- **Json**
- **Semantic Scholar API**

## Installation  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dharmil2684/Citation-Network-SNA.git
   cd Citation-Network-SNA
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

## Usage  
Run the main script to generate the citation network and compute metrics:  
```bash
python IITGandhinagar.py
```  
```bash
python NITSrinagar.py
```  

## Dataset  
The project uses a dataset of academic citations. Ensure the dataset file is placed in the appropriate directory before running the analysis.  

## Results & Insights  
- Identify key influential papers in the network.  
- Analyze how citations are distributed.  
- Visualize the structure of academic citations.
